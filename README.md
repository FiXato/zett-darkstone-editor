# zett-darkstone-editor
An isometric tile selection and placement editor by [Zett Darkstone](https://darkstone.nl) written in MSX BASIC.

== New features I've added myself since version 19:
* An `AUTOEXEC.BAS` which has a simple menu by NYYRIKKI for selecting your desired editor version

=== E20.bas
* Use `q w e r t y u i` to place corresponding tiles from the first row directly from the placement editor
* Use `Q W E R T Y U I` to place corresponding tiles from the second row directly from the placement editor
* Press `+` or `-` while in the placement editor to adjust the cursor sensitivity
* Press `h` to hide the placement cursor sprite; press `H` to make it visible again
* Refactoring

== TODO:
* Update `AUTOEXEC.BAS` with the latest usage instructions
* Show a preview of the current tile on its current location (though that might be tricky considering layering...)
* Add a menu to select a tileset.
* Export options?
